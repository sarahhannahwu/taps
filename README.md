# TAPS (Toolkit for Assessing Phones in Schools)

In this Jupyter Notebook, we provide the code for a simple TAPS data analysis tutorial. Replace the synthetic data with your school's actual data and conduct the analysis on your computer, no complicated installations required. This analysis tool will allow you to compute means and standard deviations for survey responses on various perceptions of the phone policy. In future editions, we may add functions to conduct more advanced analyses.

For dev:
To run with compose, ensure docker is installed and run `docker-compose up -d` in the project's root directory.
